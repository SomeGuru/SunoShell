🛠️ Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- Git
- Windows 10/11 (for .exe builds)

📁 Clone & Install
git clone https://github.com/SomeGuru/SunoShell.git
cd SunoShell
npm install

🧠 Project Structure
SunoShell/
├── main.js               # Electron main process
├── package.json          # App metadata & build config
├── suno.ico              # App icon (used in installer)
└── build/installer.nsh   # Optional NSIS customization

🚀 Run in Dev Mode
npm start
This launches the Electron shell with:
- Splash screen (5s)
- Suno login page
- Download interception with save dialog
- Custom Help menu with clickable links

🖼️ App Icon
Ensure suno.ico is present in the root folder.
You can convert a PNG to ICO using icoconvert.com or tools like sharp.
Icon has to be 215x215 or larger to build however. So keep that in mind, you can change the requirement for .ico to a .png file if needed. Just make sure it is the 215px by 215px size.

📦 Build Installer (.exe)
npx electron-builder --win
This creates:
- dist/SunoShell Setup.exe → Installer
- dist/win-unpacked/ → Raw unpacked build
Installer includes:
- Desktop shortcut
- Start Menu shortcut
- Custom icon
- Optional NSIS script support
