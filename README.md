# SunoShell
Simple Electron wrapper around Suno.com Generative AI Music site. This program allows you to have a desktop and start menu icon to start suno.com, it also makes sense to keep it in its own space as broswer tabs tend to get lost if you are anything like me with multiple of those tabs and browsers open. So that is why I created this application to give you the user the ability to know where your Suno is located.

Any recommends please put as enhancements in the issues tab above. Greatly appericate any feedback you can give.
